      <p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk">University of York</a>,
      studying open-ended evolution and computational reflection,
      within the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science</a> and the
      <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/yccsa/">York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis</a>,
      under the supervision of <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/">Susan Stepney</a>.</p>

      <p>My <a href="/about/">research</a> currently focuses on replicating the
        unbounded growth of complexity observed in the natural world in-silico,
        through the use of computational reflection, the ability for a system to inspect and modify its own
        behaviour as it runs. We hope to provide new insights into the conditions that could harbour early life, 
        and to use our techniques to construct the next generation of powerful meta-heuristic techniques for solving
        today's most complex engineering problems.
      </p>

        Outside of my PhD, I also maintain an interest in the wider field of natural computing, software engineering,
        artificial intelligence, as well as an avid interest in theoretical and evolutionary biology. In a past life
        I was also an indie game developer and start-up entrepreneur.

        When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy spending time karting up and down the country,
        travelling around the world, and reading books at home.
