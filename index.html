  <p>I am Systems Faculty in <a href="https://squareslab.github.io/">squaresLab</a>
  at the
  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d">Software and Societal Systems Department</a> in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs">School of Computer Science</a> at
  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
  My research focuses on the development and application of techniques for
  automatically testing, debugging and repairing robotics systems.

    When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy spending time karting up and down the country,
    travelling around the world, and reading books at home.
    In a past life I was also an indie game developer and start-up entrepreneur.
