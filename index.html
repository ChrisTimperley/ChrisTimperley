      <p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk">University of York</a>,
      studying the application of advanced meta-heuristics and machine learning
      to the problem of large-scale automated program repair, 
      within the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science</a> and the
      <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/yccsa/">York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis</a>,
      under the supervision of <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/">Susan Stepney</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Outside of my PhD, I also maintain an interest in the wider field of
        meta-heuristics, software engineering, machine learning, and even
        a little evolutionary biology.
        In a past life I was also an indie game developer and start-up entrepreneur.
      </p>

        When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy spending time karting up and down the country,
        travelling around the world, and reading books at home.
