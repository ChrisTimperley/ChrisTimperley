      <p>I am a Systems Scientist in
      <a href="http://www.clairelegoues.com/">Prof. Claire Le Goues's</a>
      <a href="https://squareslab.github.io/">squaresLab</a>
      at the
      <a href="http://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a>,
      <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
      My research focuses on the development and application of techniques for
      automatically testing, debugging and repairing robotics systems.
      Before becoming a postdoc at CMU,
      I was a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk">University of York</a>,
      supervised by <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/">Prof. Susan Stepney</a>,
      where my thesis was on search-based program repair.

        When I'm not busy with research, I enjoy spending time karting up and down the country,
        travelling around the world, and reading books at home.
        In a past life I was also an indie game developer and start-up entrepreneur.
