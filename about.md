### Research

My current research interests roughly cover, but are not limited to:

* evolutionary computation and meta-heuristics
* search-based software engineering
* automated program repair, optimisation and generation
* automated debugging
* failure-oblivious computing
* (online) machine learning

### Personal

<p>One of my greatest passions is for motorsport, whether it involves spectating or competing.
I love karting, and have competed in the <a href="http://www.bukc.co.uk">British Universities Karting Championship</a>
for several years, including a grueling, but rewarding <a href="http://www.bukc.co.uk/news/24-bukc-edition">24-hour endurance race</a>,
as well as driving in the <a href="http://www.daytonamax.co.uk/">DMAX</a> and <a href="http://www.club100.co.uk/">Club100</a> race series;
my favourite track is the breathtaking <a href="http://www.gygkarting.com/">Glan-y-Gors</a> in North Wales.</p>

I also enjoy travelling around the world and exploring different cuisines and cultures, especially by train;
thanks to my research, I've been fortunate enough to travel
abroad whilst attending conferences. I have started keeping a <a href="/travel/">little journal of my travels</a>, documenting the places I've visited so far.
