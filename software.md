### Open Source

* [**Wallace.jl.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/Wallace)<br/>
  A high-performance dynamic framework for evolutionary computation, written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Achieves the performance of C++/Java tools, such as ECJ and Evolving Objects, whilst maintaining the simplicity and
  ease-of-use of dynamic-language-based tools, such as DEAP.
* [**Push.jl.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/Push.jl)<br/>
  A Julia implementation of the [Push](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html) programming language for (auto-constructive) evolutionary computation. Integrates with Wallace to perform high-performance PushGP in Julia.
* [**RubyREVAC.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/RubyREVAC.jl)<br/>
  A simple, but effective implementation of [Eiben and Nannen's REVAC (Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration)]() method for efficiently tuning meta-heuristic parameters, written in Ruby.

### Closed Source

* **Voyager (July 2011 - July 2013)**.<br/>
  A flexible cloud-based tool for performing financial analysis and anomaly detection, built using a variety of languages and tools,
  including Ruby, Rails, AngularJS, C++, EC2, MongoDB and Redis.
* **The Guild of Dark Knights**.<br/>
