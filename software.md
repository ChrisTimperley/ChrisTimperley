### Open Source

* [**Wallace.jl.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/Wallace)<br/>
  A high-performance dynamic framework for evolutionary computation, written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Achieves the performance of C++/Java tools, such as ECJ and Evolving Objects, whilst maintaining the simplicity and
  ease-of-use of dynamic-language-based tools, such as DEAP.
* [**Push.jl.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/Push.jl)<br/>
  A Julia implementation of the [Push](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html) programming language for (auto-constructive) evolutionary computation. Integrates with Wallace to perform high-performance PushGP in Julia.
* [**RubyREVAC.**](http://github.com/ChrisTimperley/RubyREVAC)<br/>
  A simple, but effective implementation of [Eiben and Nannen's REVAC (Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration)]() method for efficiently tuning meta-heuristic parameters, written in Ruby.

### Closed Source

* **Voyager (July 2011 - July 2013)**.<br/>
  A flexible cloud-based tool for performing financial analysis and anomaly detection, built using a variety of languages and tools,
  including Ruby, Rails, AngularJS, C++, EC2, MongoDB and Redis.
* **The Guild of Dark Knights**.<br/>
  An online massively multiplayer online role-playing game, set in Medieval Britain (and later in Late Medieval Europe and Near-Asia), where players
  assumed the role of a penniless bandit, and had to plunder, steal and battle their way to the rank of king. Hand-written in PHP, MySQL, HTML,
  Javascript and CSS, when I was aged 14. At its peak, the game had over 50,000 registered users.
* **Chaos2020**.<br/>
  Following the success of TGODK, I spent two years developing Chaos2020, another highly ambitious MMORPG, set in the turmoil of a post-apocalyptic world
  in the aftermath of a nuclear war, where players come together to rebuild civilisation, fighting for control over the precious few resources left.
  After writing the game from scratch several times over, I eventually shelved it as I started university and the market sadly shrank.
* **University of York Karting Club Website**.<br/>
  Replaced an archaic website with an extensive dynamic website, complete with an events system, details results and race analysis, and track and
  driver records. Built using [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [HAML](http://haml.info/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
  [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
